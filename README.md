# CommMetrics Dashboard

This is an interactive Streamlit-based dashboard that visualizes communication metrics, including message volume, response times, and referrals processed. The dashboard displays mock data for January 2023, but it can be easily adapted to load real data for further analysis.

## Features:
- **Message Volume**: Track the volume of messages over time with an interactive line chart.
- **Response Times**: Monitor response times across different dates in a bar chart.
- **Referrals Processed**: Visualize the number of referrals processed over time with a dynamic scatter plot.
- **Summary Statistics**: View the key metrics (Message Volume, Response Times, Referrals Processed) in a detailed summary table.

## Requirements:
To run this dashboard locally, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `plotly`
- `numpy`

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CommMetrics-Dashboard.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd CommMetrics-Dashboard
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
